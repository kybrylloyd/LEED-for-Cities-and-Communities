# LEED-for-Cities-and-Communities

LEED for Cities and Communities helps local leaders create and operationalize responsible, sustainable and specific plans for natural systems, energy, water, waste, transportation and many other factors that contribute to quality of lifeâ€”revolutionizing the way cities and communities are planned, developed and operated to improve their overall sustainability and quality of life.

The LEED framework encompasses social, economic and environmental performance indicators and strategies with a clear, data-driven means of benchmarking and communicating progress.
